# Helper: print the regex that pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push hooks
# use to detect player real names in commits.
#
# The signal we want to block is "<player first name> <Capitalized word>" —
# i.e. a full real name. Player inventory records in the OBR room metadata
# carry real player names (e.g. a record's "name" field), and those names
# must never reach a commit message, the catalog, or any other tracked file
# in this public repo. The first names of the players currently at the table
# are baked in below; bare first names are allowed (they already appear
# unavoidably in CLAUDE.md, test fixtures, etc.). When a new player joins
# the table, add their first name to the alternation.

# Word-boundary on each side, alternation of first names, one-or-more
# whitespace, then a Capitalized token (the suspected last name).
